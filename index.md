# Welcome

- [Cube example](../ar-test.html "Test 001") with [Hiro target](/ImageSources/HIRO.jpg)
  *Currently, this example does not access the webcam. I may be missing references...*

- [Basic cube example](../hello-cube.html "Basic cube example by stemkoski") by [stemkoski](https://stemkoski.github.io)
  *This example works as intended, using the [Hiro target](/ImageSources/HIRO.jpg).*

- [QR-code test](../QR-cube.html) with [qr-code target](/ImageSources/qrTarget.png)
  *This example uses a custom marker based on a [QR code](/ImageSources/qrTarget.png). The idea is to be able to scan the code and use it as a target for AR content. It also works for targets sized 5cm - those that can fit on a business card.*

- [QR-code custom model test](../qr-custom-obj.html) with [qr-code target](/ImageSources/qrTarget.png)
  *This example is designed to display a company logo above the [qr-code target](/ImageSources/qrTarget.png). Use case: business card AR. Here I am using Blender's Suzanne.*

- [QR-code logo test](../qr-logo.html) with [qr-code target](/ImageSources/qr-logo.png)
  *This example is designed to display a company logo above the [qr-code target](/ImageSources/qrTarget.png). Use case: business card AR. Here I am using a 3D logo as an example.*
